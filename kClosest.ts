// https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/

// Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

// The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).

// You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

// -------------------------------------------------------------------

// so I need to find the distance for each set of points and then pop out the ones that are closest to 0. Considering, the method of getting distance, I don't need to worry about negatives. 
// since I need multiple 'smallest x', I can use a priority queue which is nlogn or sort which is also nlogn but may be less space efficient.

const kClosest = (points: number[][], k: number):number[][] => {

        x *= x
        y *= y
        distances[i] = {distance: Math.sqrt(x + y), point: points[i]}

// cutting down a little bit

console.log(kClosest2([[1,3],[-2,2]], 1)) // [[-2,2]]
console.log(kClosest2([[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], 2)) // [[3,3],[-2,4]]
